LPAICSP 91: Determining Popularity of Books on social media  
I. PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
This project aims to analyze social media activity to predict and quantify the popularity of books. By 
leveraging data from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Goodreads, and other forums, the project 
identifies trends, sentiment, and engagement levels related to specific books. The insights can help 
publishers, authors, and marketers to understand audience preferences and plan campaigns effectively. 
II. OBJECTIVES: 
1. Analyze Social Media Metrics: Identify key metrics such as likes, shares, comments, 
hashtags, and mentions that determine the   popularity of books. 
2. Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on user-generated content (e.g., tweets, 
posts, reviews) to understand audience opinions. 
3. Predictive Modeling: Build a machine learning model to predict the popularity score of a 
book based on social media data. 
4. Trend Tracking: Detect trending books and genres in real-time using social media activity. 
5. Recommendation: Suggest strategies to boost book visibility based on insights derived from 
data. 
III. PREREQUISITES AND REQUIREMENTS: 
1. Technical Prerequisite: Programming Knowledge, Data Science and Machine Learning 
Knowledge, Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
2. Data Requirements: Social media data from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and 
Goodreads.  
3. Hardware and Software Requirements: A system with at least 8GB RAM and sufficient 
storage for managing text-heavy datasets. Cloud resources for large-scale data processing 
(e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure). APIs for data collection: Twitter API, Instagram API, and 
Goodreads API. Libraries for text analysis: NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob. Databases like 
MySQL, MongoDB, or cloud-based storage for large datasets. 
IV. TECHNOLOGIES USED: 
1. Pandas: Essential for data manipulation, such as cleaning and merging datasets. 
2. Matplotlib: Helps visualize data trends and relationships through plots, making insights more 
accessible. 
3. Seaborn: Enhances the understanding of data through advanced visualizations, including 
heatmaps and pair plots. 
4. Scikit-learn: A versatile library for building and evaluating machine learning models, 
offering tools for regression, classification, and clustering.
